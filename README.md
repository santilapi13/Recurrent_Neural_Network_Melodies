# RNN Long-Short Term Memory to generate melodies üé∂
This project is fully based on Valerio Velardo videos about AI and music: https://github.com/musikalkemist
RNN-LSTM model trained with traditional German melodies to generate coherent melodies from a initial seed of notes and silences.

## Explanation üëì
In the following document it is explained, in Spanish, how this works

If you do not speak Spanish, Valerio Velardo explains it really well in his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLr0r-QhqH0&list=PL-wATfeyAMNr0KMutwtbeDCmpwvtul-Xz
